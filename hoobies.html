                    <h2>1. Beatboxing</h2>
                    <p>- Beatboxing, a vocal art form, unleashes a symphony of rhythm using only the human voice.
                        With percussive beats and captivating melodies, beatboxers create a mesmerizing musical experience.
                        From imitating instruments to producing mind-bending sound effects, they push the boundaries of vocal expression. 
                        This is something most people are not able to do and  am quite happy with this hooby.
